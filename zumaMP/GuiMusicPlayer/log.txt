--To Do: 

The repeat button doesnt work if its just one song, for it gets the 
next song node while the song is playing i think, so it wouldnt be able to tell if you 
set repeat already. i think. look into it more


Getting the album cover seems tough, the lib chatgpt reccomands is in c++
figure out a way in c, try to use c++, or dont add it at all. it would be cool 


also, need to see if i could start the file chooser in the music directory
