-- To Do: 

Before a gui, need to figure out how to pause, skip, etc. 

So something about signals to do playback? idk 

I am storing songs in doubly linked lists. Maybe then put it to a hashtable, 
the key being the playlist and the value being the head of the linked list...

Also would like to keep the players in a serperate players folder, so need to adjust the 
make file and such.
