TO DO: 



//Okay, its working okay


Now, it crashes when pressed really fast for a long time. 

Maybe i should implement a mutex, idk if i need it or not. 

I want to make it where you can go to the previous song if the playlist ends 

overall, should try to clean up the code a bit before moving foward


then, i want to implement the feature to choose a song

also, if the directory is empty, need to make a case for that 

maybe also make the skip update the song if it is paused?
